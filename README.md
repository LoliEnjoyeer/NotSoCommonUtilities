- Plugin idea came while looking at exiled version of the plugin created by Exiled team I think? (https://github.com/Exiled-Team/Common-Utils) thought it's really awesome and wanted to create something similar yet something different for Synapse users
- code is mine
- C.A.S.S.I.E Messages looked up at steam guide (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2275568019) created by Feiah (https://steamcommunity.com/id/Feiah)
