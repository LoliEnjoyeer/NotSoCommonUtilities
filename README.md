# NotSoCommonUtilities
Synapse plugin for game SCP Secret Laboratory that adds features to make game experience more interesting. Each feature can be disabled separately in config file.

## Features for now

#### Automated Nuke Detonation
- Prevents people from camping in the facility for too long
- Can't be disabled by a player (Will give config for that later)
- C.A.S.S.I.E Has special message for that event

#### Randomised blackouts and flickers
- After configurable time lights in LCZ and HCZ are starting to freak out
- After X seconds in every room there is % chance of:
  - Lights going out completely and closing doors in the room
  - Lights are going to flicker for a second
- C.A.S.S.I.E Has special message for that event as well
- After activating 3 generators blackouts stop for good

#### Coins blocking doors
- Coins finally getting some usage
- While having coin in hand interact with door to block them, it will:
  1 Close the doors (if they aren't closed)
  2 Lock them for X amount of seconds 


## TODO List

- Guards can escape turning into mtf
- Mtf/CI can escort other team turning them into their own
- Easy custom loudouts with pure config file
- custom 914 recipes
- ability to blindfold somebody
- Ability for players to fix blackouts permamently âœ…
- Maybe more...


## Credits
- Plugin idea came while looking at exiled version of the plugin created by Exiled team I think? (https://github.com/Exiled-Team/Common-Utils) thought it's really awesome and wanted to create something similar yet something different for Synapse users
- code is mine
- C.A.S.S.I.E Messages looked up at steam guide (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2275568019) created by Feiah (https://steamcommunity.com/id/Feiah)
- will add more credits as I add more functionality to the plugin
